        Michelle is a Chicagoland Singer and Actor that was born from the magical combination
        of a Musician Father, and a Sassy Dancing Mama.  They supported her from the moment
        she told them in Kindergarten that she wanted to be a singer and told her to work hard
        and stay focused.  That lead Michelle to audition for her first High School Musical,
        "Honk!" where she played the lead role of the Ugly Ducking(her finest hour).  She went
        on to formally train in Musical Theater at Western Illinois University, receiving her
        BFA. After that she went to work, and work she has for the past seven years as a singer and Actor. 
        She has most recently worked with Theater Companies such as <a href="http://coffeeandwhiskeyproductions.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Coffee and Whiskey Productions</a>,
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/byotproductions/" target="_blank">BYOT Productions</a>, and <a href="https://www.invictustheatreco.com/" target="_blank">Invictus</a>.  Due to circumstances of the global pandemic kind, 
        she's put a hold on performing live until things are safe again.  However, she has 
        been working with her favorite group of artists as previousley mentioned on several
        virtual shows.  Michelle is currently studying at Northeastern Illinois University to
        become a Full Stack Web Developer.  She hopes to bring what she learns to independent
        theaters and small businesses.
